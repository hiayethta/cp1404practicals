# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have actually started using a "TO-DO" app to organise what work
has to get done for each subject, and by what date.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I usually complete watching the lectures by the time the seminars are held; so I have not been
attending seminars because I'm not confident that I know the content well enough
to engage in discussion.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching all the lecture videos.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Stop avoiding seminars.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Possibly switch due dates? I.e. Online tests due on Sunday and practicals due on Monday?
